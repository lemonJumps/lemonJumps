- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @lemonJumps

I'm an artiast and an engineer, I've been programming in various programming languages for 9 years
While I love mostly c++ and python, my proffesional career is built on doing embedded c/c++ for usually arm based microcontrollers, but i did get my hands on PPC64 and various 8 bit machines 

I'm currently spending time developing a python based 3d engine
